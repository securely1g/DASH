# DASH BMv2 source build with Bazel

The Bazel path compiles the existing BMv2 P4 pipeline with the declared p4c
execution tool, runs the existing SAI generator in a private source tree, and
invokes the original SAI metadata and DASH library Make targets through
`rules_foreign_cc`. It does not invoke Debian packaging. Existing Docker/Make
builds remain available with their original source files.

The adapter copies the generated source directory into a private writable build
directory. It first selects the upstream `libsaimetadata.so` target, which
generates the metadata headers and library, then builds the DASH library. It
does not run the upstream metadata developer `all` target or its header-check
scripts; the native CI gates below validate the installed producer artifacts.
The private SAI archive reuses the landed registry `configurable_aspell.patch`
(pinned URL and integrity), and metadata generation selects the declared `aspell`
executable and dictionaries through `SAI_ASPELL`. The source patch bytes match
the same patch in the draft registry snapshot; it is not another module-registry
endpoint. The legacy source tree keeps its original system executable.

Both legacy compile recipes retain their warning policies, except that
`-Wmissing-include-dirs` stays a warning for the paired source/generated
search candidates provided by Bazel. Missing headers and other warnings promoted by `-Werror`
still fail the build.

The adapter links the declared PI, gRPC, protobuf and Abseil libraries into
`libsai.so`'s dependency list and rejects unresolved symbols at link time. The
runtime test also loads the extracted library with `RTLD_NOW` from a separate
program that does not link the SDK, then queries generated APIs with an SDK
consumer. This catches dependencies that a consumer's own linkage could hide.

Public targets:

| Target | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `//:runtime` | Stripped `libsai.so`, `libdashsaimetadata.so`, and four generated `/etc/dash` pipeline files |
| `//:runtime.debug_symbols` | Matching detached symbols under `/usr/lib/debug/.build-id` |
| `//:sdk` | Installed public headers and a DASH SAI library for C++ consumers to link |
| `//bazel:runtime_test` | Standalone runtime loading, installed SDK switch/generated DASH VIP API queries, pipeline validation, dependency closure, debug IDs/checksums, and GDB source-line lookup |

Native Trixie AMD64 and ARM64 are the validation configurations. Cross-compiling
the source generator/metadata executables is not supported. Set both platforms
for ARM64:

```sh
bazel test //bazel:runtime_test \
  --platforms=@sonic_build_infra//platforms:aarch64_trixie \
  --host_platform=@sonic_build_infra//platforms:aarch64_trixie
```

AMD64 is the default. Bazel 8.5.1, compiler/tool dependencies and generator wheels
are declared. The tests run `readelf`, `objcopy` and GDB from the CI environment to
inspect outputs. Compilation uses the declared shared toolchain and target
dependencies; target dependency imports do not count as source builds of those
external libraries.

`requirements_lock.txt` is checked-in Python dependency input.
`MODULE.bazel.lock` is ignored generated resolution state retained in CI evidence.
`-g` and `--strip=never` preserve build-time symbols; shared `sonic_deploy_tar`
rules split the deployed runtime and debug TARs from the same linked ELF.

The draft CI fetches one exact commit from the shared registry, replacing its
normal `main` endpoint for the run. That snapshot combines the separate PI,
p4c, shared-tool and foreign-build prerequisites. Remove this draft substitution
once they land; the PR cannot become Ready before the native
matrix passes against landed registry entries. Workflow artifacts contain both
TARs, checksums, source/registry revisions, test results and the generated lock.

The draft prerequisites are:

| Module | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- |
| `rules_distroless@0.9.4.sonic.10` | [Declared C++ header roots, registry #96](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-bazel-registry/pull/96) |
| `p4lang-pi@0.1.3.sonic.2` | [PI source and runtime metadata, registry #107](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-bazel-registry/pull/107) |
| `p4c@1.2.4.2.sonic.2` | [P4C source and runtime metadata, registry #109](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-bazel-registry/pull/109) |
| `sonic-build-infra@0.0.21-787a4efffd91fb8be872d4ef2772d2b17ef3c0b0` | [Shared build tools, registry #118](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-bazel-registry/pull/118) |
| `rules_foreign_cc@0.16.0.sonic.1` | [Header search classifications, registry #119](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-bazel-registry/pull/119) |

The two `Native source and TARs` checks are required on `main`. Their successful source builds and installed runtime/debug tests are merge gates; a completed analysis or a queued workflow does not satisfy them.
